# Data-visualization-capstone-Coursera.
This purpose of this project is to increase the skills of processing data and drawing graph to visualize data.   

The datasets are downloaded from WHO- malaria cases (17/05/2022). Based on the number of malaria cases in each year, let answer the following questions:
  +  In 2020, what is the top ten countries with highest total malaria cases / malaria cases caused by *P. falciparum* / malaria cases caused by *P. vivax*.
  +  What is the top 3 countries in each year? What is the top 3 countries having highest degree of changes in each year.
  +  Choose 6 countries (3 from highest cases, 3 from highest degree of increase), draw a line graph of each one over years.
  +  Identify the min, max, median of each country 2010-2020. 

The result of the analysis can be viewed here: <a href="https://rpubs.com/minhtri/904952" target="_blank">RPubs</a>
